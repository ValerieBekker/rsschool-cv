### About Me
I am 27 years old and have been teaching foreign languages for six years. I also work as a content contributor to the American educational platform Quizlet. I am hardworking, diligent, and perseverant, and I do not mind doing both monotonous work and tasks that require critical thinking. I have fluent English as well as Spanish, which helps me in my line of work as well as communication with people in general since I travel quite often. I decided to explore a new field, as programming has been interesting to me for some time. I am currently focusing on mastering JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS in order to acquire the knowledge that I need to become a front-end developer.
